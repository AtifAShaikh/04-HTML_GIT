        My name is Atif Shaikh. I was born in India and raised in Los Angeles.
        I have recently graduated from UCR with a bachelors in neuroscience (Go Highlanders!).
        I am looking to transition to the tech field and I am super excited for a career in web development.
        My hobbies include coding, video game development, ultimate frisbee (when we were allowed to), running, hiking, calisthenics, cooking food, 
        and most importantly eating food.
